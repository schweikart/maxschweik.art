# Max Schweikart :profile-picture

Hello, nice to meet you!

I'm Max, a computer science student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu).
I enjoy contributing to [open source projects](#projects), cooking and bouldering.

This website contains all the stuff that I think might be useful to others and that I am allowed to release.
Take a look around and let me know if you could use my stuff for anything cool! :)
